## Delinea-SecretServer

`Delinea-SecretServer` is the original backwards-compatible PAM type. It supports all three authentication methods
(`password`, `client_credentials`, `windows`) selected at runtime via the `GrantType` configuration parameter.
The Keyfactor Command UI will display every credential field regardless of which grant type is active.

For new installations, use the type-specific variants (`Delinea-SecretServer-Password`,
`Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials`, or `Delinea-SecretServer-Windows`) which only show the fields relevant
to the chosen authentication method.

## Requirements

- Delinea Secret Server instance accessible over HTTPS from the host running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.
- A service account or application account with permission to view the secrets being retrieved. See the
  [Delinea Secret Server documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/api-scripting/authentication/script-token-auth/index.htm)
  for information on configuring service accounts and application accounts.
- `GrantType` is optional and defaults to `password` when omitted. It is case-sensitive and must be exactly `password`, `client_credentials` or `windows`; the shipped `manifest.json` placeholder `password|client_credentials|windows` must be replaced with one of these.
- The `SecretFieldName` value must match a field's name or slug on the secret exactly (the comparison is case-sensitive). An empty value, or a field that does not exist on the secret, is an error.

**Dummy values (`N/A`).** The Keyfactor Command UI requires all declared fields of this type to be populated. For
fields that do not apply to the chosen authentication flow, enter `N/A` as the value. The provider treats `N/A`
(case-insensitive) as an empty value and does not use it. The type-specific PAM types avoid this because they only
expose the fields relevant to their authentication flow.

## Delinea-SecretServer Registration Snippets

Shared registration and naming rules are described in [Registration and Naming](https://github.com/Keyfactor/delinea-secretserver-pam/blob/main/README.md#registration-and-naming).

This generic type selects its authentication flow from `GrantType` and defaults to `password` when it is not supplied. For new installations prefer the type-specific PAM types.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A Universal Orchestrator supports only **one** PAM provider registration per `manifest.json` (until UO v26.4). The shipped `manifest.json` registers this generic type. To use a type-specific provider instead, replace `manifest.json` with that type's manifest file. Using more than one Delinea PAM type requires a separate Universal Orchestrator for each.

### Generic: Universal Orchestrator manifest

The release ships this registration as `manifest.json`. It contains exactly this registration and this `InitializationInfo` section:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "Keyfactor.Platform.Extensions.IPAMProvider": {
      "YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME": {
        "assemblyPath": "delinea-secretserver-pam.dll",
        "TypeFullName": "Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPam"
      }
    }
  },
  "Keyfactor:PAMProviders:YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME:InitializationInfo": {
    "Host": "https://example.secretservercloud.com/SecretServer",
    "Username": "<USERNAME>",
    "Password": "<PASSWORD>",
    "ClientId": "<OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>",
    "ClientSecret": "<OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "GrantType": "password|client_credentials|windows"
  }
}
```

### Generic: Command 10 `web.config` registration

```xml
<register type="IPAMProvider" mapTo="Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPam, delinea-secretserver-pam" name="Delinea-SecretServer" />
```

The assembly name in `mapTo` is the name of the extension DLL (`delinea-secretserver-pam`), and the class is the one for this PAM type.
