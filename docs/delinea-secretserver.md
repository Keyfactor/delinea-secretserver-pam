## Delinea-SecretServer

`Delinea-SecretServer` is the original backwards-compatible PAM type. It supports all three authentication methods
(`password`, `client_credentials`, `windows`) selected at runtime via the `GrantType` configuration parameter.
The Keyfactor Command UI will display every credential field regardless of which grant type is active.

For new installations, use the type-specific variants (`Delinea-SecretServer-Password`,
`Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials`, or `Delinea-SecretServer-Windows`) which only show the fields relevant
to the chosen authentication method.

## Requirements

- Delinea Secret Server instance accessible over HTTPS from the host running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.
- A service account or application account with permission to view the secrets being retrieved. See the
  [Delinea Secret Server documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/api-scripting/authentication/script-token-auth/index.htm)
  for information on configuring service accounts and application accounts.
