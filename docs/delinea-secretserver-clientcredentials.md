## Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials

The `Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials` PAM type authenticates to Delinea Secret Server using OAuth2 client
credentials (application account name and password). This is the recommended type for service-to-service
integrations where an application account is used instead of a user account.

## Requirements

- Delinea Secret Server instance accessible over HTTPS from the host running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.
- An application account (Client ID and Client Secret) with permission to view the secrets being retrieved. See the
  [Delinea Secret Server documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/api-scripting/authentication/script-token-auth/index.htm)
  for information on configuring application accounts.
