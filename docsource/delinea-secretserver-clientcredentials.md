## Overview

The `Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials` PAM type authenticates to Delinea Secret Server using an application
account (Client ID and Client Secret). This is the recommended type for service-to-service integrations where an
application account is used instead of a user account.

Secret Server's `/oauth2/token` endpoint is always called with `grant_type=password`. The provider therefore sends the
Client ID as the token request's `username` and the Client Secret as its `password`; this is how Secret Server expects
application accounts to authenticate.

## Requirements

- Delinea Secret Server instance accessible over HTTPS from the host running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.
- An application account (Client ID and Client Secret) with permission to view the secrets being retrieved. See the
  [Delinea Secret Server documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/api-scripting/authentication/script-token-auth/index.htm)
  for information on configuring application accounts.
- The `SecretFieldName` value must match a field's name or slug on the secret exactly (the comparison is case-sensitive). An empty value, or a field that does not exist on the secret, is an error.

## Platform Install

1. On the server that hosts Keyfactor Command, download and unzip the latest release of the Delinea Secret Server PAM Provider from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

2. Copy the assemblies to the appropriate directories on the Keyfactor Command server:

    <details><summary>Keyfactor Command 11+</summary>

    1. Copy the unzipped assemblies to each of the following directories:

        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\Extensions\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebConsole\Extensions\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\KeyfactorAPI\Extensions\delinea-secretserver-pam`

    </details>

    <details><summary>Keyfactor Command 10</summary>

    1. Copy the assemblies to each of the following directories:

        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\bin\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\KeyfactorAPI\bin\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebConsole\bin\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\Service\delinea-secretserver-pam`

    2. Open a text editor on the Keyfactor Command server as an administrator and open the `web.config` file located in the `WebAgentServices` directory.

    3. In the `web.config` file, locate the `<container> </container>` section and add the following registration:

        ```xml
        <container>
            ...
            <!--The following are PAM Provider registrations. Uncomment them to use them in the Keyfactor Product:-->

            <!--Add the following line exactly to register the PAM Provider-->
            <register type="IPAMProvider" mapTo="Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPamClientCredentials, delinea-secretserver-pam" name="Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials" />
        </container>
        ```

    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of the directories listed in step 1. The configuration files are located in the following paths by default:

        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\web.config`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\KeyfactorAPI\web.config`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebConsole\web.config`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\Service\CMSTimerService.exe.config`

    </details>

3. Restart the Keyfactor Command services (`iisreset`).

## Orchestrator Install

> [!NOTE]
> Before installing, create the PAM type and define a provider instance in Keyfactor Command, as described in the sections above for this PAM type and in [Usage](#usage).

1. Install the Delinea Secret Server PAM Provider assemblies as described in Step 1 of [Installing on a Universal Orchestrator](#installing-on-a-universal-orchestrator).

2. To use `Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials`, replace the contents of `manifest.json` with the contents of `ClientCredentials-manifest.json` (for example, delete `manifest.json` and rename `ClientCredentials-manifest.json` to `manifest.json`). The file contents are shown in [Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials Registration Snippets](#delinea-secretserver-clientcredentials-registration-snippets).

3. Edit `manifest.json` as described in Step 3 of [Installing on a Universal Orchestrator](#installing-on-a-universal-orchestrator): replace `YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME` with the name of your PAM provider in Keyfactor Command and fill in the placeholder values from the [requirements](docs/delinea-secretserver-clientcredentials.md#requirements) section.

4. Restart the Universal Orchestrator service after editing `manifest.json`.

## Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials Registration Snippets

Shared registration and naming rules are described in [Registration and Naming](https://github.com/Keyfactor/delinea-secretserver-pam/blob/main/README.md#registration-and-naming).

This type always uses the `client_credentials` flow. A `GrantType` value is not needed and is ignored. If the type-specific class is not the one registered in `manifest.json`, the Universal Orchestrator loads the generic provider, which defaults to `password`.

### ClientCredentials: Universal Orchestrator manifest

The release ships this registration as `ClientCredentials-manifest.json`; rename it to `manifest.json` on install. It contains exactly this registration and this `InitializationInfo` section:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "Keyfactor.Platform.Extensions.IPAMProvider": {
      "YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME": {
        "assemblyPath": "delinea-secretserver-pam.dll",
        "TypeFullName": "Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPamClientCredentials"
      }
    }
  },
  "Keyfactor:PAMProviders:YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME:InitializationInfo": {
    "Host": "https://example.secretservercloud.com/SecretServer",
    "ClientId": "<OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>",
    "ClientSecret": "<OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET>"
  }
}
```

### ClientCredentials: Command 10 `web.config` registration

```xml
<register type="IPAMProvider" mapTo="Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPamClientCredentials, delinea-secretserver-pam" name="Delinea-SecretServer-ClientCredentials" />
```

The assembly name in `mapTo` is the name of the extension DLL (`delinea-secretserver-pam`), and the class is the one for this PAM type.
