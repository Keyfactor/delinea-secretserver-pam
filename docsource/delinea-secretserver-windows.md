## Overview

The `Delinea-SecretServer-Windows` PAM type authenticates to Delinea Secret Server using Integrated Windows
Authentication (IWA). No credentials are required in the configuration; the provider uses the Windows identity
of the process running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator. No access token is requested; the secret is
retrieved from the `/winauthwebservices/api/v1/secrets/{id}` endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrated Windows Authentication is not supported on Delinea Secret Server Cloud. This type is only compatible
> with on-premises Secret Server installations.

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrated Windows Authentication is not supported on Delinea Secret Server Cloud. This type is only compatible
> with on-premises Secret Server installations.

- On-premises Delinea Secret Server instance accessible from the host running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.
- The Windows service account running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator must have permission to view
  the secrets being retrieved. See the
  [Delinea Secret Server IWA documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/authentication/iwa-webservices/webservice-iwa-powershell/index.htm)
  for information on configuring IWA access.
- The Secret Server instance must be configured to allow Integrated Windows Authentication web service access.
- The `SecretFieldName` value must match a field's name or slug on the secret exactly (the comparison is case-sensitive). An empty value, or a field that does not exist on the secret, is an error.

## Platform Install

1. On the server that hosts Keyfactor Command, download and unzip the latest release of the Delinea Secret Server PAM Provider from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

2. Copy the assemblies to the appropriate directories on the Keyfactor Command server:

    <details><summary>Keyfactor Command 11+</summary>

    1. Copy the unzipped assemblies to each of the following directories:

        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\Extensions\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebConsole\Extensions\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\KeyfactorAPI\Extensions\delinea-secretserver-pam`

    </details>

    <details><summary>Keyfactor Command 10</summary>

    1. Copy the assemblies to each of the following directories:

        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\bin\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\KeyfactorAPI\bin\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebConsole\bin\delinea-secretserver-pam`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\Service\delinea-secretserver-pam`

    2. Open a text editor on the Keyfactor Command server as an administrator and open the `web.config` file located in the `WebAgentServices` directory.

    3. In the `web.config` file, locate the `<container> </container>` section and add the following registration:

        ```xml
        <container>
            ...
            <!--The following are PAM Provider registrations. Uncomment them to use them in the Keyfactor Product:-->

            <!--Add the following line exactly to register the PAM Provider-->
            <register type="IPAMProvider" mapTo="Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPamWindows, delinea-secretserver-pam" name="Delinea-SecretServer-Windows" />
        </container>
        ```

    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of the directories listed in step 1. The configuration files are located in the following paths by default:

        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\web.config`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\KeyfactorAPI\web.config`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebConsole\web.config`
        * `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\Service\CMSTimerService.exe.config`

    </details>

3. Restart the Keyfactor Command services (`iisreset`).

## Orchestrator Install

> [!NOTE]
> Before installing, create the PAM type and define a provider instance in Keyfactor Command, as described in the sections above for this PAM type and in [Usage](#usage).

1. Install the Delinea Secret Server PAM Provider assemblies as described in Step 1 of [Installing on a Universal Orchestrator](#installing-on-a-universal-orchestrator).

2. To use `Delinea-SecretServer-Windows`, replace the contents of `manifest.json` with the contents of `Windows-manifest.json` (for example, delete `manifest.json` and rename `Windows-manifest.json` to `manifest.json`). The file contents are shown in [Delinea-SecretServer-Windows Registration Snippets](#delinea-secretserver-windows-registration-snippets).

3. Edit `manifest.json` as described in Step 3 of [Installing on a Universal Orchestrator](#installing-on-a-universal-orchestrator): replace `YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME` with the name of your PAM provider in Keyfactor Command and fill in the placeholder values from the [requirements](docs/delinea-secretserver-windows.md#requirements) section.

4. Restart the Universal Orchestrator service after editing `manifest.json`.

## Delinea-SecretServer-Windows Registration Snippets

Shared registration and naming rules are described in [Registration and Naming](/README.md#registration-and-naming).

This type always uses Integrated Windows Authentication. A `GrantType` value is not needed and is ignored.

### Windows: Universal Orchestrator manifest

The release ships this registration as `Windows-manifest.json`; rename it to `manifest.json` on install. It contains exactly this registration and this `InitializationInfo` section:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "Keyfactor.Platform.Extensions.IPAMProvider": {
      "YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME": {
        "assemblyPath": "delinea-secretserver-pam.dll",
        "TypeFullName": "Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPamWindows"
      }
    }
  },
  "Keyfactor:PAMProviders:YOUR-PROVIDER-NAME:InitializationInfo": {
    "Host": "https://example.secretserver.internal/SecretServer"
  }
}
```

### Windows: Command 10 `web.config` registration

```xml
<register type="IPAMProvider" mapTo="Keyfactor.Extensions.Pam.Delinea.SecretServerPamWindows, delinea-secretserver-pam" name="Delinea-SecretServer-Windows" />
```

The assembly name in `mapTo` is the name of the extension DLL (`delinea-secretserver-pam`), and the class is the one for this PAM type.
