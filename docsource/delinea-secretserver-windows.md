## Overview

The `Delinea-SecretServer-Windows` PAM type authenticates to Delinea Secret Server using Integrated Windows
Authentication (IWA). No credentials are required in the configuration — the provider uses the Windows identity
of the process running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrated Windows Authentication is not supported on Delinea Secret Server Cloud. This type is only compatible
> with on-premises Secret Server installations.

## Requirements

- On-premises Delinea Secret Server instance accessible from the host running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator.
- The Windows service account running Keyfactor Command or the Universal Orchestrator must have permission to view
  the secrets being retrieved. See the
  [Delinea Secret Server IWA documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/authentication/iwa-webservices/webservice-iwa-powershell/index.htm)
  for information on configuring IWA access.
- The Secret Server instance must be configured to allow Integrated Windows Authentication web service access.
